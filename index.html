<p>This is some text. By default, it will be all on one line. <br>However, we can use line breaks to form new lines within paragraphs</br></p>

<p>This is a new paragraph with some new text!</p>

<p>But what if I want to include a <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a>?</p>

<p>Or, what about an image?</p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Tabby_cat_with_blue_eyes-3336579.jpg" alt="a decorative picture of a cat" width=500px>

<p style="color:Teal;">What if I want to style my text? For a full website, you would add another file using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), but we can do some basic stuff in HTML.</p>

<p style="color:#18453b;">You can use the 140 recognized colors in HTML, or you can use a hex code for a more specific color.</p>

<p>You can also add <em>italics</em> or <strong>bold</strong> text directly in the html.</p>
